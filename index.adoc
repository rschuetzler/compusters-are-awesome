= Preface
I think computers are awesome.
I also think that most people don't realize just how awesome their computers can be.
This book serves as a collection of tips, tricks, tutorials, and other things that show how awesome computers can be.

The intended audience for this book is anyone who uses a computer.
I try to write things in such a way that anyone--from a computer novice to an experienced user looking to harness just a little more of the power of their computer--can learn and understand.
My plan is to grow and expand the book as I discover new ways that computers can be turned into the ultimate tool to make your life easier.
