I firmly believe that computers are awesome.
I also think that most people don't realize just how awesome their computers can be.
This book serves as a collection of tips, tricks, tutorials, and other things that show how awesome computers can be.

The intended audience for this book is anyone who uses a computer.
I try to write things in such a way that anyone--from a computer novice to an experienced user looking to harness just a little more of the power of their computer--can learn and understand.
My plan is to grow and expand the book as I discover new ways that computers can be turned into the ultimate tool to make your life easier.

== Who am I?
I am Ryan Schuetzler, a lifelong nerd and computing enthusiast.
I am an assistant professor of Information Systems at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
I've been using and messing around with computers for almost as much of my life as I can remember.
I didn't turn into a true geek until college when I majored in Information Systems, but I've loved playing around with computers and learning new things about them my whole life.

== What is the point of this book?
After a few years teaching college, I've realized that a lot of people don't realize just how much their computers can do for them.
This book is an attempt to fix some of that.

== I have a suggestion!
I'd love to hear it!
I'm always interested in learning new things and teaching others.
